6103 packets sniffed from three web pages
Out of them, 172 (2.8%) were UDP packets
Current IP Address: 172.18.36.119

From those, we chose one packet we sent: (query)
It's a packet we've sent from our PC since the source IP is our own.
The source port is 47053 and the destination port (server listening on) is 53
Source IP is 172.18.36.119 and the destination IP is 132.70.60.124
Source MAC is 34:f6:4b:bb:04:9a and the destination MAC is 00:1c:7f:00:00:01

The corresponding packet is: (response)
A packet we've received from the previous destination IP (now as source IP)
The source port is 53 (the server) and the destination port is 47053 (client)
Source IP is 132.70.60.124 (server) and the destination IP is 172.18.36.119 (client)
Source MAC is 00:1c:7f:65:e9:35 and destination MAC is 34:f6:4b:bb:04:9a

When we filter the packets we send by DNS and our source IP we can see that every two packets we send,
the source port changes, while the destination port is always the same.
Which means that we open a socket with a random port each packet we send.
When we reverse the filter to packets we receive, we can see that the destination port
of the packets changes accordingly to our generated socket for that packet query and response,
while the source port (53) always stays the same (the server's listening port).
As such, we can see that we can filter for packets sent by the DNS query-response protocol
by simply filtering by the 53 port which seems to be reserved to DNS queries.
